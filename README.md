## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I just completed the Frontend Mentor profile card component challenge, and it was a great learning experience for me. By working on this project, I got better at using CSS flexbox to make responsive layouts. 


### Continued development

Those challenges from Frontend Mentor really keep me motivated to complete every challenge I started, and I have set a challenge to complete all the challeges in thier website. I don't know how much time would that take me, but I'm sure if I completed all of those challeges my skills would be much much better.
